# Repository of a plugin for BigBlueButton

## Description

Display a word cloud formed with the words said in chat.

## Next steps

* [ ] Option to enable and disable the plugin (right now it replaces the presentation area and you can't change it)
* [ ] Clear the word cloud when the chat is cleared or add an option for the presenter to do so
* [ ] Better way to start a new cloud (replace the command `/cloud`)
* [ ] Synchronize the cloud between all participants (at the moment each client renders its own cloud)
* [ ] Don't need to re-render the cloud every time a resize is triggered, this can be improved
* [ ] This plugin can become a bigger one: collect input from users (not only from chat, there are several options) and display them (not only as a word cloud, there are many ways to show data visually)

## Building the Plugin

To build the plugin for production use, follow these steps:

```bash
cd $HOME/src/plugin-template
npm ci
npm run build-bundle
```

The above command will generate the `dist` folder, containing the bundled JavaScript file named `<plugin-name>.js`. This file can be hosted on any HTTPS server along with its `manifest.json`.

If you install the Plugin separated to the manifest, remember to change the `javascriptEntrypointUrl` in the `manifest.json` to the correct endpoint.

To use the plugin in BigBlueButton, send this parameter along in create call:

```
pluginManifests=[{"url":"<your-domain>/path/to/manifest.json"}]
```

Or additionally, you can add this same configuration in the `.properties` file from `bbb-web` in `/usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties`

## Required Client Settings

This plugin requires that you provide specific settings in your client configuration to indicate the URL for the illustration image used by the plugin. Without these settings, the plugin will not display the illustration as intended.

Example configuration:

```yaml
plugins:
    - name: WordCloudPlugin
      url: <<PLUGIN_URL>>/manifest.json
      settings:
          panelImageUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/path/to/wordcloud-illustration.svg'
```

Make sure to replace the URL with the actual location of your asset.
